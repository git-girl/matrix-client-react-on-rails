# Starting on the Project 

I think using react was actually the least pain   
I spent some time on :
- setting up deployment 
  - switching database for that 

- getting the api to work  
  - setting up redis for that 
  - setting up sidekiq for that 

- atm trying to setup the rubocop diagnostics
